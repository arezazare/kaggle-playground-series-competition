# ðŸ§ª Kaggle Playground Series Competition

This repository is a structured collection of my solutions to Kaggle's **Playground Series** competitions â€” a monthly set of approachable, practical ML challenges designed to sharpen modeling skills.

Each folder contains:
- ðŸ“Š Full modeling pipeline (EDA â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Modeling â†’ Submission)
- ðŸ§  Experiment tracking (tuned vs pre-tuned models)
- ðŸ’¡ Reflections on model performance and learning
